<h1>Rules for allowable actions on Relationship Tree</h1>
<h2>Terms<br>
</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Primary Record</dt>
<dd>The record that was selected from the initial "Select
Record" screen. &nbsp;This record is shown as the first child of
it's Domain on the Relationship Tree.<br><br>&nbsp;<img style="width: 301px; height: 60px;" alt="" src="../attach/RecordDragRules/PrimaryRecord.png"><br></dd><dt>Related Domain</dt><dd>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">A domain under a realtionship. &nbsp;The
domain is associated with a parent domain via a specific
relationship.&nbsp; For example, for Company -&gt;Owns Locations,
Centerpoint, &nbsp;Locations is a related domain. &nbsp; All domains on
the tree are related domains except the root domain.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></dd><dt>
Record of the Domain</dt><dd>The record for which the relationships are established/defined<br><br><img style="width: 360px; height: 332px;" alt="" src="../attach/RecordDragRules/RecordNomenclature.png"><br></dd></dl><dl>
</dl>

<h2>Handling of the root Domain node<br>
</h2>
<br>
No actions are avialable for this node. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
<h2>Handling delete of the "Primary Record"</h2>
The first child in the Relatinship Tree is the Primary Record, its
parent is the Domain that that record belongs to.&nbsp;
&nbsp;(Example: &nbsp;UKPatient &gt; Dr. George Karlin)<br>
<br>
If the primary record is selected and the user chooses delete than all
relationships to that record are removed. &nbsp;The relationship
tree will then look like a relationship tree for a record without any
relationships. &nbsp;I.E. it will show&nbsp; Relationship
&gt; Domain &gt; <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">Add
Records</span> nodes for each Domain that the Primary Records's
domain has relationships defined for.<br>
<br>
<h2>Supported actions by context&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<br>If &nbsp;an action is not supported at any given time the action should be
grayed out.<br><br>

<h2>Multiseletion on record tree<br>
</h2>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Typical
multi-select. &nbsp;Ctrl+MouseBtn1 or Ctrl+Space and arrows to move.<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br><br>User can not select the root node. &nbsp;<br><br>
A user can only move a set of records that are located under the same
parent. &nbsp; If the user has selected nodes from different
parents nodes than the Move and Drag/Drop are disabled. <br><br><br>
<h2>Selecting Reassign&nbsp;</h2>This shows a tree on the right hand side that has <span style="font-weight: bold;">all</span>
the records&nbsp;for the root domain and their associated
relationships. (The domain associated with the original record). &nbsp;<br><br>In the our example this would show all UKPatients (iregardless of if they have a relationship or not)<br><br>The records would all be collapsed to start with. &nbsp;<br><br><br>
<h2>Drag / Drop (DnD) and Move&nbsp;<br>
</h2>
<br>
For the purposes of showing&nbsp; what records can be dragged I
will assume that the destination tree is shown. &nbsp; Also, when
the destination tree is shown the user can drag/drop or move from
either tree to either tree. &nbsp; This works the same way for
both trees, however for the purposes of explaining how the drag / drop
works I will show drags from the source tree to the destination tree. <br><br>Both
trees should also be updated once a node has been moved. &nbsp;
However, both&nbsp;trees should preserve what nodes where openned and
where the user has scrolled to. To the user it should only look as
though the old records have been moved from one place to the other. <br><br><h3>General Rules</h3><ol><li>If
the “record of the domain” is same for the drop, then the drop should
not be allowed.&nbsp; In other words the “record of the domain” should
always be different for the drop.</li><li>The key condition parameters to check during the drag and drop are<br><ul><li>relationship</li><li>domain</li><li>related domain</li><li>record of the domain</li></ul></li></ol>

<h3>Primary Record</h3><br>Can not be selected for move nor drag / drop. <br><br><h3>Relationships</h3><br>Can be dragged either to a record located under the
same domain as the source record of the relationship or to the same
relationship located under the same domain. <br><br>&nbsp;A relationship can only be dropped on <br><ul><li>the record of the same parent domain</li><li>the same relationship under the same parent domain</li></ul><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><img style="width: 707px; height: 210px;" alt="" src="../attach/RecordDragRules/MoveRelationship.png"><br></div><br> <h4>Notes <br></h4><ul><li>Re-assigns all records under each domain with the same relationship to the new record associated with the relationship. <br><br>For
example, in the above diagram all records in Centerpoint &gt; Owns
Offices are now assigned to BoughtCenterpoint. &nbsp; This includes all
the records under the the Locations and Commoities domains. <br></li><li>Should show a prompt comfirming the move of the relationships.</li><li>Records under the dropped relationship&nbsp;</li><ul><li>Are&nbsp;appended to the existing records of &nbsp;the same related domain</li></ul><ul><li>If the record already exists the system should overwrite the record with the relationship information from the dropped record</li></ul></ul>
<h3>Related Domains</h3><br>Can be dragged either to the same domain under the same relationship or to the relationship that the domain is under. <br><br>A related domain can only be dropped&nbsp;<br><ul><li value="1"><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Under&nbsp;the same relationship and under the record of the same domain</p></li><li value="1"><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">On &nbsp;the same related domain and under the same relationship and under the record of the same domain</p></li></ul>
<p style="margin-left: 0.38in; margin-bottom: 0in;"><br>
</p><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><img style="width: 726px; height: 209px;" alt="" src="../attach/RecordDragRules/MoveDomain.png"><br></div><br><h4>Notes <br></h4><ul><li>Re-assigns
all records under the selected domain with the same relationship to the
new record associated with the relationship. &nbsp; For example, in the
above diagram all&nbsp;Centerpoint &gt; Owns &gt; Commities
relationships to records under Commities would be moved from
Centerpoint to BoughtCenterpoint. <br></li><li>Should show a prompt comfirming the move of the relationships.</li><li>Records under the dropped related domain&nbsp;</li><ul><li>Are&nbsp;appended to the existing records of &nbsp;the same related domain</li></ul><ul><li>If the record already exists the system should overwrite the record with the relationship information from the dropped record</li></ul></ul><br>
<h3>Records</h3><br>Can be dragged either to the same domain located under the
same relationship &gt; parent domain or&nbsp; a record under the same domain &gt;
relationship &gt; parent domain as shown here.<br><br><br>The records can be dropped on same related domain and under the same relationship and under the record of the same domain,<br><br>In the following
example both highlighted nodes would be reassigned to BoughtCenterpoint
&gt; Owns &gt; Locations. &nbsp; Neither highlighted node could have
been dragged to Commodites because the domains do not match.
&nbsp;Finally, any of the nodes located under Locations could have been moved. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><img style="width: 681px; height: 210px;" alt="" src="../attach/RecordDragRules/MoveRecord.png"><br></div>
<h4>Notes </h4><ul><li>Re-assigns all the relationships to the selected nodes to the new record. <br></li><li>Should
show a prompt comfirming that (N) records that will be moved. &nbsp;
Example: This will move 2 records to BoughtCenterpoint -&gt; Owns
Location. &nbsp;Do you wish to reassign these records?</li><li>Allowing
the user to drag a record to a record under the same related domain,
relationship and parent domain is a nice to have feature. &nbsp; &nbsp;</li><li>Dropped records&nbsp;</li><ul><li>Are&nbsp;appended to the existing records of &nbsp;the same related domain</li></ul><ul><li>If the record already exists the system should overwrite the record with the relationship information from the dropped record</li></ul></ul><p></p><p></p>
