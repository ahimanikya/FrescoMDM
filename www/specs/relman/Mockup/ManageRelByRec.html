<h1>Manage-&gt;Relationship-&gt;Maintain-&gt;By
Record &nbsp;<a href="relman/Mockup/ManageRelMaintain.htm#ByRelationship">
</a></h1>
<h2>Use Cases</h2>
<ul>
<li> View and maintain relationships for a<span style="font-weight: bold;"> single
record</span> and all relationships to all associated records. </li>
<li> View details of selected relationship (source record,
destination record and relationship attributes)
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Implementation Details</h2>
<h3><a href="ManRelbyRecSB.html">Story Boards.
&nbsp;View this story board to see how the following screens
interact.</a></h3>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Screens</h2>
<br>
<h3>Select Record Overlay </h3>
<br>
When the user selects the "by Record" option the following screen is
shown.<br>
<span class="note-highlight" style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"></span><span class="note-highlight" style="font-style: italic;"></span><span class="note-highlight"></span><br>
<br>
<img style="width: 650px; height: 313px;" alt="" src="../attach/SearchForRecord.png"><br>
<br>
<h4>Storyboard</h4>
<h5>Initial view of dialog </h5>
<ol>
<li>Do not show the search critieria. &nbsp;This would be
shown once a domain was selected.</li>
<li>Do not show the table for the search results this would
first be shown after the search button in the search area is selected.</li>
</ol>
<h4><span style="font-weight: bold; color: blue;">Updates
Needed</span></h4>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Should change "Search" to "Select" &nbsp;and call this "Select
Record". &nbsp;That way the button on the main area and the button on
this dialog match. </li><li>Nice to have: Add the option&nbsp;to
select a subset of domains to show relationships for. This should be
populated with the set of domains that have relationships to
the&nbsp; domain selected above. The user should be able to any
number
of domains. &nbsp;By default all domains are selected for
showing.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h3>Maintain by Record Main screen</h3>
<br>
<span class="note-highlight" style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Screen
after the Domain "UKPatient" and the record "George Karlin" is
selected. </span><br>

record "Centerpoint" was selected<br>

<h4><br><span class="note-highlight" style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Screen

record&nbsp;Centerpoint, Owns Offices was expanded and the record "Bangalore" was selected.&nbsp;</span></h4><br><img style="width: 926px; height: 706px;" alt="" src="../attach/RelByRecordS3.png"><br>
<br>
<h4><span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">Notes on Relationship Model overview</span></h4><br><ul><li>The windows should be minized by default</li></ul><br><h4><span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">Notes on Tree Usage</span></h4><br><ul><li>Selecting a relationship type allows deletion of all the records in the relationship.</li><li>Selecting a domain disables Delete and Add.</li><li>Allow
for multi-selected. &nbsp;If more than one record is selected then the
right hand side should be blank and the number shown by Delete should
be updated.&nbsp;</li><li>Move could be implemented by finding a record
and moving all selected records under the record (similiar to how the
hierarchy tree works) or better yet by showing a second tree on the
right that just displays a Find Record button (and hide) and allowing for drag /
drop between the two trees (current on right, new on left) </li><li>Do not &nbsp;allow any record that is already in its parent path to be expanded (stop cyclic references) <br>Example: &nbsp;Below "Dr. George Karlin" is not expandable because the record is already expanded. <br><br>If
Centerpoint-&gt;Bangalore had children relationships that refered back
to Centerpoint than that node would not be expandable. <br></li><li>Build
in a configurable limits to the number of records to show under a node.
&nbsp;If too many records would be shown then the tree would show a
paginated table of the nodes and a More... &nbsp;button (for when the
table is dismissed). For the session if a record is selected from that
table
it appears in the tree list and under the parent node prior to the
More... button. <br><br>Nice to have would be the abliity to filter the table as follows: <br><br><ul><li>Names of destination records (optional)</li><li>Relationship attributes (optional)</li></ul>&nbsp;<br>Here is an example of what a simple implementation of &nbsp;too many nodes to show might look like:<br><br><img style="width: 499px; height: 317px;" alt="" src="../attach/TreeTooManyRecords.png"></li></ul><br><h4><span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">Organization on tree</span></h4><br>The first two nodes on the tree are always<br><br><ul><li style="font-style: italic;">Domain of selected record</li><ul><li style="font-style: italic;">selected record</li></ul></ul><br>After that the data sbould be organized as follows<br><br><ul><li>Relationships (alphabetical)&nbsp;</li><ul><li>Domains&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><ul><li>Records&nbsp;</li></ul></ul></ul><br>Here is a more complete example than shown above. &nbsp; <br><br>Notice that Dr. George Karlin is not expandable under Centerpoint &lt;- Employed By. <br><br><img style="width: 301px; height: 710px;" alt="" src="../attach/RelByRecordTreeByRel.png"><br><br><h4><span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">Alternate to Tree Look and Feel</span></h4><br>Go
back to the box look as shown on the Story Board and add a "Make
Current Record" option that would switch the current node to the
selected node. <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br><br>The user could navigate back to the original record as it would be shown in one of the relationships in the boxes. <br><br>To see the&nbsp;<a href="ManRelByRecTable.html">Table Look and Feel</a> click <a href="ManRelByRecTable.html"><big><span style="text-decoration: underline;">here</span></big></a>. <br><h4><span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">

<h3>Add Records to Relationship<br>
</h3>
<span class="note-highlight" style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Note: This is
a wireframe model of the screen</span><br>
<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 999px; height: 544px;" alt="" src="../attach/MaintainByRecordAddRecord.png"><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>. <br>
<h3>Find Dialog</h3><br>A typical find dialog such as the following.<br><br><img style="width: 284px; height: 98px;" alt="" src="../attach/FindRecord.png"><br><br><h3>Move Dialog</h3>
&nbsp;<br>If records are selected brings up a dialog that allows the
selection of a relationship associated with the domain of the selected
record. &nbsp; &nbsp;Selection of nodes for the move are limted to
records in the same domain. &nbsp;I.E. the Move option is grayed out if
records in different domains are selected<br><br>If a domain is
selected brings up a dialog that allows the selection of another record
in the same domain as the parent record of the relationship. &nbsp;<br>Example:&nbsp;Dr.
George Karlin &gt; Associate Of &gt; UK Doctor is selected.&nbsp; The
Move Dialog brings up a Move "Associate Of" dialog with the option to
select a new UK Patient record. &nbsp;All the records in this node are
now re-assigned to the new record. &nbsp; &nbsp;An example use case is
that the job perfomred by Dr. George Karlin&nbsp; that made him
&nbsp;an Associated of the UK Doctors is now performed by a different
patient. &nbsp;<br><br><h2>Alternate Look of tree with "Destination&gt;&gt;" option</h2>
<br>
The following shows the look of the Manage Hierarchy tree with a <a href="ManHeirMove.html"><span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;Destination&gt;&gt;</span></a> option. &nbsp;The look of the Relationship Tree would be very similiar. &nbsp; <br><br>The
difference is that when the "Show Move" option is on the user is only
allowed to multi-select nodes children nodes. &nbsp;Similiarly the user
can only move the records to another relationship associated with the
same domain. &nbsp; (For example, the user can not move UKPatient
records to the Company domain) <br><br>Also a user may move all the
records under a relationship by selecting a domain under a relationship
on one side of the tree and a record belonging to the domain of the
relationship. &nbsp; Example: Dr. George Karlin &gt; Associate Of &gt;
UK Doctor is selected on the left hand tree and dragged to Centerpoint
&gt; Employed By &gt; Fred Smith. &nbsp; &nbsp;After the drag all the
records under Dr. George Karlin &gt; Associate Of &gt; UK Doctor are
now shown as "Fred Smith &gt; Associate Of &gt; UK Doctor". <br><br>Note:
the details of the move for the Relationships may have to be worked on,
so Show Move is a nice to have feature for the Relationship. <br><br>
