<h1>Manage-&gt;Relationship-&gt;Maintain-&gt;By
Record &nbsp;<a href="relman/Mockup/ManageRelMaintain.htm#ByRelationship">
</a></h1>
<h2>Use Cases</h2>
<ul>
<li> View and maintain relationships for a<span style="font-weight: bold;"> single
record</span> and all relationships to all associated records.
&nbsp;This includes</li>
<ul>
<li>Deleting relationships</li>
<li>Adding relationships</li>
<li>Moving relationships &nbsp;from one record to another
record in the same domain. &nbsp;Example, &nbsp;a Location that
was Owned by&nbsp;Centerpoint is now owned by Global
Enterprise.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Moving all relationships associated with one record to a
different record. &nbsp;Example: &nbsp; Example, Dr. Andrea
Smith takes over for Dr. George Karlin and all the relationships that
use to be associated with Dr. George Karlin are now associated with Dr.
Andrea Smith.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<li> View details of selected relationship (source record,
destination record and relationship attributes)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Implementation Details</h2>
<h3><a href="ManRelbyRecSB.html">Story Boards.
&nbsp;View this story board to see how the following screens
interact.</a></h3>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Screens</h2>
<br>
<h3>Select Record Overlay </h3>
<br>
When the user selects the "by Record" option the following screen is
shown.<br>
<span class="note-highlight" style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"></span><span class="note-highlight" style="font-style: italic;"></span><span class="note-highlight"></span><br>

<br>
<h4>Storyboard</h4>
<h5>Initial view of dialog </h5>
<ol>
<li>Do not show the search critieria. &nbsp;This would be
shown once a domain was selected.</li>
<li>Do not show the table for the search results this would
first be shown after the search button in the search area is selected.</li>
</ol>
<h4><span style="font-weight: bold; color: blue;">Updates
Needed</span></h4>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Should change "Search" to "Select" &nbsp;and call this
"Select
Record". &nbsp;That way the button on the main area and the button
on
this dialog match. </li>
<li>Nice to have: Add the option&nbsp;to
select a subset of domains to show relationships for. This should be
populated with the set of domains that have relationships to
the&nbsp; domain selected above. The user should be able to any
number
of domains. &nbsp;By default all domains are selected for
showing.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h3>Maintain by Record Main screen</h3>

<h4><span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">Notes on
Relationship Model overview</span></h4>
<br>
<ul>
<li>The windows should be minized by default</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4><span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">Notes on
Tree Usage</span></h4>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Selecting a relationship type allows deletion of all the
records in the relationship.</li>
<li>Selecting a domain disables Delete and Add.</li>
<li>Allow
for multi-selected. &nbsp;If more than one record is selected then
the
right hand side should be blank and the number shown by Delete should
be updated.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Move could be implemented by finding a record
and moving all selected records under the record (similiar to how the
hierarchy tree works) or better yet by showing a second tree on the
right that just displays a Find Record button (and hide) and allowing
for drag /
drop between the two trees (current on right, new on left) </li>
<li>Do not &nbsp;allow any record that is already in its
parent path to be expanded (stop cyclic references) <br>
Example: &nbsp;Below "Dr. George Karlin" is not expandable because
the record is already expanded. <br>
<br>
If
Centerpoint-&gt;Bangalore had children relationships that refered
back
to Centerpoint than that node would not be expandable. <br>
</li>
<li>Build
in a configurable limits to the number of records to show under a node.
&nbsp;If too many records would be shown then the tree would show a
paginated table of the nodes and a More... &nbsp;button (for when
the
table is dismissed). For the session if a record is selected from that
table
it appears in the tree list and under the parent node prior to the
More... button. <br>
<br>
Nice to have would be the abliity to filter the table as follows: <br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Names of destination records (optional)</li>
<li>Relationship attributes (optional)</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;<br>
Here is an example of what a simple implementation of &nbsp;too
many nodes to show might look like:<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 499px; height: 317px;" alt="" src="../attach/TreeTooManyRecords.png"></li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4><span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">Organization
on tree</span></h4>
<br>
The first two nodes on the tree are always<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li style="font-style: italic;">Domain of selected record</li>
<ul>
<li style="font-style: italic;">selected record</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<br>
After that the data sbould be organized as follows<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Relationships (alphabetical)&nbsp;</li>
<ul>
<li>Domains&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Records&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<br>
Here is a more complete example than shown above. &nbsp; <br>
<br>
Notice that Dr. George Karlin is not expandable under Centerpoint
&lt;- Employed By. <br>
<br>

<br>
<h4><span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">Alternate
to Tree Look and Feel</span></h4>
<br>
Go
back to the box look as shown on the Story Board and add a "Make
Current Record" option that would switch the current node to the
selected node. <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
<br>
The user could navigate back to the original record as it would be
shown in one of the relationships in the boxes. <br>

<h3>Add Records to Relationship<br>
</h3>
<span class="note-highlight" style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Note: This is
a wireframe model of the screen</span><br>
<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 999px; height: 544px;" alt="" src="../attach/MaintainByRecordAddRecord.png"><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>.<br>
<h3>Find Dialog</h3>
<br>
A typical find dialog such as the following. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Nice to have would be to specify a one of the types of Searches to
restrict what the user is searching for.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Entire Tree</li>
<li>Relationships</li>
<li>Domains</li>
<li>Records&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<br>
<img style="width: 284px; height: 98px;" alt="" src="../attach/FindRecord.png"><br>
<br>
<h3>Move Dialog</h3>
<br>
Only available if nodes under the same parent have been selected or a
single node has been selected. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
The user is given choices of where to move the node/s based on the type
of node selected as follows.<br>
<br>
<dl>
<dt>Relationships&nbsp;</dt>
<dd>The dialog shows a message indicating what will be moved.
&nbsp;Example, Move relationships associated with the 2 selected
relationships to a new Company. </dd><dd><br>A&nbsp;search screen for the same domain
as the parent record of the relationship is also shown. &nbsp;The user can then
select the new record to re-assign all records that share the
relationship to the original record.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Example, the user selects&nbsp;
-&gt; Owns Offices and &lt;- Employed By relationships under
Centerpoint. &nbsp;The move dialog shows a search screen for
Company domain. &nbsp;The user can search for the record to that
will replace Centerpoint for these two relationships.<br><br>
</dd>
<dt>Domains</dt><dd>The dialog shows a message indicating what will be moved. &nbsp;Example,
Move relationships associated with the selected domain to a
new Company. </dd></dl><dl>
<dd>User is presented with a search screen for the same domain
as the parent record of the relationship. &nbsp;The user can then
select the new
record to re-assign all records that share the relationship to the
original record.&nbsp;</dd>
<dd></dd>
<dd>Example, the user selects Locations under Company &gt;
Centerpoint &gt; Owns . &nbsp;The move dialog shows a search
screen for the Company domain. from which the user selects teh record to re-assign all the Locations under Company &gt;
Centerpoint &gt; Owns to. <br> <br>
</dd>
<dt>Records</dt>
<dd>The dialog shows a message indicating what will be moved. Example,&nbsp; Move selected Centerpoint -&gt; Owns Locations to another Company.</dd><dt></dt><dd>User is presented with a search screen for the same domain
as the parent record of the relationship. &nbsp;The user can then
select the new
record to re-assign all records that share the relationship to the
original record.&nbsp;</dd><dd></dd><dd>Example, the user selects records unde&nbsp;&nbsp; Company &gt;
Centerpoint &gt; Owns &gt; Locations . &nbsp;The move dialog shows a search
screen for the Company domain from which the user selects the record to re-assign the  Company &gt;
Centerpoint &gt; Owns &gt; &nbsp;relationships to.<br> </dd><dd><br> &nbsp;<br></dd>
</dl>
In other words the dialogs work similar to the <a href="RecordsMoveRules.html"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rules for allowable actions on
Relationship Tree. </span></a>
The
difference being that instead of using drag / drop the user is guided
by the Move dialog to choices that make sense given the context of the
currently selected nodes
<dl>
<dt>&nbsp; &nbsp;</dt>
</dl>
<h2>Alternate Look of tree with "Destination&gt;&gt;"
option</h2>
<br>
<br>
The following shows the look of the Manage Hierarchy tree with a <a href="ManHeirMove.html"><span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;Destination&gt;&gt;</span></a>
option. &nbsp;The look of the Relationship Tree would be very
similiar however there are some important differences. <br>
<br>
These differences have to do with the way drag / drop and the actions
for the tree work and can be read about at <a href="RecordsMoveRules.html"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rules for allowable actions on
Relationship Tree.</span></a><br>
