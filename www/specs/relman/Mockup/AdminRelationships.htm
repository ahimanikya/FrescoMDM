<h1 class="pagename"><a name="Top"></a>Administer-&gt;Relationships</h1>
<p>Provides a template for linking relationships within or
across domains. A relationship is associated with a relationship type
like ManagerOf and the source and target domains.<br />
<br />
</p>
<h2>Use Cases</h2>
<ul>
<li> View and maintain relationship templates
including the 'direction' of the relationship (A -&gt; B, A
&lt;--&gt; B)&nbsp;
</li>
<li> View and maintain which predefined attributes are included
and required by a relationship </li>
<li> View and maintain custom attributes associated with the
specific relationship.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Screen</h2>

<br />
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>If moving several items at a time via the Move
Up/Down &nbsp;function acts as if each line was moved separately.
&nbsp;I.E. For
Move Up - Adate would move before AString and &nbsp;Afloat would
move before
AnInt.</li>
<li>A clone feature would be&nbsp;'nice to have'.
&nbsp;These would bring up the entire list for the associated
'browse'
function so a user could select and clone a definition.</li>
<li>Title of the overlay. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<ul>
<li>Launched from Add... 'Add Relationship'&nbsp;</li>
<li>Launched forom Edit... 'Edit Relationship'</li>
</ul>
<li>The Edit Relationship screen needs to check if the database
has any data
associated with the Relationship. &nbsp;If it does than everything
in the
dialog should be disabled except Plugin,
Description, Required check boxes, Add and Searchable.</li><li>The
ablity to update values on the main screen is a nice to have
feature. &nbsp;It is recommended that &nbsp;for the first release all
editing of
values occurs on the overlay.&nbsp;Thus the save and revert buttons
will not be needed on the main Administer-&gt;Relationships tab.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Implementing the Available Progress Bars</h2>
<br />
The
progress bars are considered a "nice to have" feature. &nbsp;
&nbsp;They inform the user on the number for each datatype that is
available to use as a custom attribute. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
When the user
adds an attribute of a certain type the value in the bar is increased
by one. &nbsp;When the bar gets to 100% than the specified type can
not be selected from the type pull down. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Other
updates to the bar are made when an attribute is deleted or the type is
changed. &nbsp;Deleting an attribute decresses the available count
by one.
&nbsp;Changing the type decresses the available count for the old
type by
one and incresses the count for the new type by one.
&nbsp;(Example,
changing "AString" to type char would make the strings count 1 of 20
and the char count 76 of 100).<br />
