<h1 id="section-RelationshipsMaintain-ManageRelationshipsMaintain">Manage-&gt;Relationships-&gt;Maintain</h1>
<p>View and maintain existing relationships depending on
the user's current access control. This allows exploration of
relationships by showing associated relationships. </p>
<p>As with all the other screens details about a record and
relationship properties can be viewed by selecting a record.</p>
<br />
<h2>Maintain - By Relationship</h2>
<h3>Use Cases&nbsp;</h3>
<ul>
<li> View and maintain all the records in a
relationship</li>
<li> View details of selected relationships to
see details of source and target record</li>
<li> View relationship properties for selected
relationship</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<h2>Maintain - by Record</h2>
<ul>
</ul>
<h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Use Cases</h3>
<ul>
<li> View and maintain relationships for a<span style="font-weight: bold;"> single
record</span> to all its associated records. </li>
<li> View details of selected record (either main
record or record in a relationship)
</li>
<li> View relationship properties if a
relationship is selected - by selecting a record within that
relationship.
</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Screens</h3>
<br />
<h4>1. Select by Record </h4>
<br />
When first selected a Search Dialog is shown with a message to Select
the record to find relationships to.
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<table class="imageplugin" align="center" border="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><img src="../attach/RecordRelationshipS2.png" /></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h5><span style="font-weight: bold; color: blue;">Updates
Needed</span></h5>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Title this dialog. &nbsp;Record Search. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Option to use last record found.</li>
<li>Add instructions if needed to the dialog.</li>
<li> Add the option&nbsp;to
select a subset of domains to show relationships for. This should be
populated with the set of domains that have relationships to
the&nbsp; domain selected above. The user should be able to select
1 + domains. &nbsp;By default all domains are selected for showing.
&nbsp;The next screen would then limit the records shown to the
filtered domains. </li>
<li> Add an option to expand relationships to a
single domain when first showing the screen. This will open the
relationships direction area that contains the relationship and also
expand that relationship. All other relationships will be collapsed.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A cancel button.</li>
</ul>
<h4>2. Maintain by Record&nbsp;</h4>
<br />
The best way to show this would be to use a brain map.
&nbsp;However, given our current resources this screen is using the
brain map concept for inspiration.<br />
<br />
<h5>Layout</h5>
<p>The Maintain by Record screen should be laid out as follows
(of course the Source Record area should have a Search... button).
&nbsp;This screen would be visible under the Search dialog.</p>
<p><img style="width: 486px; height: 374px;" alt="Sketch of new layout" src="../attach/RecordRelationshipReorg.png" /><br />
</p>
<br />
<h5>Initial screen if areas are expanded</h5>
<br />
To give an idea of what each of the areas looks like if it is expanded
prior to expanding. &nbsp;See below. &nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"><br />
</span>The layout for the following should be more like the above
including the titles. &nbsp; We also should give a way to hide /
show the entire relationship type (arrow and all) so the user can focus
on the records they would like to see.<br />
<br />
<table class="imageplugin" align="center" border="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><img src="../attach/RecordRelationshipS1.png" /></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<br />
<br />
<h5>Screen after selection and expansion</h5>
<br />
<p>
After a single record is selected and the user has expanded all the
domain relationships. &nbsp;The &nbsp;areas would look like
this. &nbsp;(Re-aranged as per the first sketch) </p>
<table class="imageplugin" align="center" border="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><img src="../attach/RecordRelationshipS3.png" /></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<br />
<h6>Notes</h6>
<br />
<ul>
<li>By default each direction area is collapsed. (I.E.
Relationships To, Bi-Directional and Relationships From)</li>
<ul>
<li>If the user indicated the domain that they would like to
see expanded on the search screen or the record only has relationships
to one domain then expand the direction area that contains that domain.
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Also expand the
relationships to the selected domain inside each area.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Data for each area should only be retrieved when the area
is first expanded.</li>
</ul>
<li>Only the direction area that contains any relationships are
shown.</li>
</ul>
<h6><span style="color: blue;">Updates Needed</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></h6>
<ul>
<li> Sort relationships by domain name. </li>
<li> Allow each of the three areas to be hidden
or shown. </li>
<li> Add buttons to allow drill down from Record
Summary to MIDM record.
</li>
<li> Make the area around the record larger.
</li>
<li> Add a summary title to the right hand side
indicating the current selected relationship
</li>
<li> Title the three areas as "Relationships To",
"Bi-Directional" and "Relationships From" . </li>
<li> Allow an area to be minimized. &nbsp;Starting
with the areas being minimized
</li>
<li>Add filtering to show / hide relationships to domains on
the screen rather than have to reshow the search screen </li>
</ul>
