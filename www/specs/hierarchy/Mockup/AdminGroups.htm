<p>Define what domains are in a group. Also define what
attributes are with each group relationship.
</p><h2>Use Cases&nbsp;</h2><ul><li>View and maintain group definitions.
</li><li> View and maintain attributes that are associated
with a specific group -&gt; domain relationship. Such as how long
the relationship is good for. i.e. how long is a record in a group. </li>
<li> View and maintain extended attributes a specific
group -&gt; domain relationship. </li>
</ul>

<h2><span style="color: blue;">Updates
Needed</span></h2><br /><ul>
<li> Select Group should read 'Group Definitions'
</li>
<li> 'Domains in Group' should read 'Define Domains in
Group'
</li>
<li> Change Add to Add... and bring up the property box
when the Add button is selected. Users can save without completing all
information, but the pop up dialog will show each time. </li>
<li> Change title of Property window to 'Define
Properties for'. NOTE: from should have been for.
</li>
<li> Display Name for the Group should be shown by the
selected <b>domain</b>. Group Display Name | Domain. At
first the Display name is the same as the Group name. </li>
<li> Nice to have. Allow user to suppress show showing
the display name
</li>
<li> Remove filter as we do not expect that many domains
in one system
</li>
<li> Add a button that allows all properties to be
selected. This should be in the table column
</li>
<li> Allow the user to indicate that a property is
'searchable' - the GUI would restrict these to N searchable properties
by type. (Example: 10 dates, 4 strings...). The GUI should indicated
how many searchable fields of each type are still available. </li>
<li> Add the option to select a plug in that will handle
this relationship. </li>
</ul>
<span style="color: red;"> Swaranjit - IMO group
should not traverse across domains, because a group attributes may well
be different in different domains. Any benefit of using same group
across domains? Moreover a group name such as Household represents a
group Type name since there would be many 'household' groups. Or we can
use group Type name as group name, and assume there are many groups
with same name 'household'.<br />

Andrea - A group is just a name. &nbsp;Each domain - group has its
own set of attributes. &nbsp;The screen represents that a users
thinks of the group name first, not the domain. &nbsp;Example, I
can have a group called household associated with a UK Patient.
&nbsp;I can have a different group called household associated with
USA Patient. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
So while I expect that the group is stored for a domain I believe it
would be nice to implement the groups as per this screen.
&nbsp;What this suggest is a convenience API that gives all the
groups defined for all the domains.&nbsp; &nbsp;If we can not
then we can have a list of domains first. &nbsp;And then add all
groups for that domain. &nbsp;<br /><br />
