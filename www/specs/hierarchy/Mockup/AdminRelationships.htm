<h1 class="pagename"><a name="Top"></a>Administer-&gt;Relationships</h1>
<p>Provides a template for linking relationships within or
across domains. A relationship is associated with a relationship type
like ManagerOf and the source and target domains.<br />
<br />
</p>
<h2>Use Cases</h2>
<ul>
<li> View and maintain relationship templates
including the 'direction' of the relationship (A -&gt; B, A
&lt;--&gt; B, note B -&gt; A is implied)
</li>
<li> View and maintain attributes that are associated
with the relationship, such as how long the relationship is good for. </li>
<li> View and maintain extended attributes for the
specific relationship. </li>
</ul>

<h2><span style="color: red;">Issues</span></h2>
<ul>
<li> Should the extended attributes be defined in
the Netbeans GUI? The perfect solution would be that once a service was
deployed once it did not have to be deployed again in order to update
attributes. In this case the Netbeans GUI would connect to the running
service after it was initially deployed in the same way as the Web
Application. If this can not be implemented than Netbeans is the
correct place to handle the creation of the extended attributes as
these would certainly be used by the Relationship rules editor.<br />
<br />
<b>Answer:</b> Extended
attributes shall be definable in both the Netbeans GUI and on the Web.
It is important to note that extended attributes once used can not be
removed. Additionally extended attributes are defined for each
relationship type. Future enhancements might include keeping track of a
set of common extended attributes.<br />
<ul>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<br />
<h2>
<span style="color: blue;">Updates
Needed</span></h2>
<ul>
<li> 'Relationships for' should read 'Define
Relationships for'
</li>
<li> Change Add to Add... and bring up the property box
when the Add button is selected. Users can save without completing all
information, but the pop up dialog will show each time. </li>
<li> Change title of Property window to 'Define
Properties for'. NOTE: from should have been for.
</li>
<li> Nice to have. Allow user to suppress showing the
display name
</li>
<li> Remove filter as we do not expect that many domains
in one system
</li>
<li> Add a button that allows all properties to be
selected. This should be in the table column
</li>
<li> The direction of a unused relationship should show a
drop down list so that a user can change the direction. </li>
<li> Allow the user to indicate that a property is
'searchable' - the GUI would restrict these to N searchable properties
by type. (Example: 10 dates, 4 strings...). The GUI should indicated
how many searchable fields of each type are still available. </li>
<li> Add the option to select a plug in that will handle
this relationship. </li>
</ul>
