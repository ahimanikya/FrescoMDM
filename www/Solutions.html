To help you get quickly started using Mural applications for specific
tasks, we created a set of models, or templates, that you can download
and use to create a master index application that is already geared to
a specific type of data. We identified common models and requirements
for different industries and created templates based on those unique
needs. Note that this is a work in progress, and we will continue to
create additional models and make them available for downloading.
<p> The models demonstrate how certain data types can
be implemented in the MDM Suite. The data structure and the
standardization and matching rules are based on the specific
requirements for the type of data being processed. For example, both
the United States and Australia patient models use first and last names
for blocking and matching, but the United States version also uses the
Social Security Number, while the Australian version uses a Tax File
Number. </p>

<p>Currently, the following models are available for
you to download and use. </p>

<p style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(238, 107, 0);">United
States Patient Model </p>

<p>The United States Patient model is based on the
specific data processing requirements for a healthcare implementation
in the United States. To learn about how the model was designed and
configured, see <a href="http://open-dm-mi.dev.java.net/docs/solutions/usa-patient.html">United
States of America Patient Solution</a>. </p>

<p style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(238, 107, 0);">Australia
Patient Model </p>

<p>The Australia Patient model is based on the
specific data processing requirements for a healthcare implementation
in Australia. To learn about how the model was designed and configured,
see <a href="http://open-dm-mi.dev.java.net/docs/solutions/aus-patient.html">Australian
Patient Solution</a>. </p>

<p style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(238, 107, 0);">United
Kingdom Patient Model </p>

<p>The United Kingdom Patient model is based on the
specific data processing requirements for a healthcare implementation
in the United Kingdom. To learn about how the model was designed and
configured, see <a href="http://open-dm-mi.dev.java.net/docs/solutions/uk-patient.html">United
Kingdom Patient Solution</a>. </p>

<p style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(238, 107, 0);">Create Your Own Solutions</p>

<p>You are welcome to share your models here as
well, and we provide a template to help you out when developing your own
solutions. To view the solutions template, see
<a href="http://open-dm-mi.dev.java.net/docs/solutions/SolutionsTemplate.html">Solutions
Template</a>. </p>
